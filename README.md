**HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standardized markup language for viewing web pages in a browser. Browsers serve HTML documents from a server over HTTP/HTTPS or open them from a local disk, then interpret the code in an interface that is displayed on the monitor screen.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. Using HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, can be embedded in the rendered page. HTML provides a means for creating structured documents by indicating the structural semantics of text, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other elements. HTML elements are formatted with tags written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> or <input /> together display content on the page. Other tags, such as <p>, surround text and provide information about it, and can also include other tags as subelements. Browsers do not display HTML tags, but execute them to interpret page content.**
